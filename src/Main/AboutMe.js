                        Hello! My name is Osmer, and I am capable and adaptable when it comes to dealing with various technologies.
                        To obtain more experience and information, as well as to work with my colleagues. To be able to add the 
                        strength of the company and make a positive impact. 
                    </p>
                    <p>Apart from being a software developer, I enjoy most of my time being outdoors. In the summer, we play basketball, travel with family and freinds.</p>
                    <p>When forced indoors, I follow a number of series of anime and fantasy movies and television shows, and I spend a large amount of my free time exploring the latest technology advancements.
